# Welcome to my repository of PythonHardWay!

[*Learn Python The Hard Way* is a tutorial page for absolute beginners. **I can offer it to everyone who has no experience of computer programming but wants to start it.**](learnpythonthehardway.org) Our *Mentors* at *CodeCool* have told us to solve the first 43 tasks of it. Most of them are very easy: You have to copy some sample code (by typing -- not copy-pasting, of course), run and understand it, insert your experiences as comments and sometimes fill it with your own code. This is the repository I have worked on when doing [*Learn Python The Hard Way*](learnpythonthehardway.org) exercises. The last three exercises are not ready yet, but I will make it up as soon as possible.

Thank you for visiting my repository! [Have a nice day! >:)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCg2BoKiuOM)
